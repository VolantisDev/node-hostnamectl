# hostnamectl

This simple node module allows you to control the hostname using the hostnamectl utility.

The commands are natively run using sudo, so either the script should be run as root or the user running the script should have sudo access to the systemctl command.

## Requirements

- Archlinux or another OS which uses the hostnamectl command

## Usage
